# HR_Analysis_and_dashboard
Here's a project I worked on, an interactive HR dashboard showing the total employee and the attrition rates over the years, various factors were considered as shown below, some of which include Department, Age-group, Gender, etc. All this is to explore the reasons behind the 16.12% attrition rate. 
I can say working on this project is really insightful as I have learned some attributes to look out for when working on similar data sets.
Project inspiration: Data Tutorial.
